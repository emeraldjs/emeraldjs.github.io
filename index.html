	<p class="paragraph">Once upon a time, there was a small black and brown and white dog. She was a quiet little dog. She had been on her own for what felt like a long time, but she never felt lonely. She had a very powerful nose which took her where she needed to go, and it told her when there was trouble and it was time to leave.</p>
	<p class="para-paragraph">One day she came upon a small farm with chickens and sheep and a spotted horse. She met eyes with an old man who was working in the barn. He greeted her kindly and she reciprocated with a tail wag, appreciating his gentle manner. Her nose told her that he was not someone to fear. He then reached into his pocket and removed a piece of jerky, held it in his outstretched palm, and knelt down. She sniffed it just once before gobbling it up. The man took out two more pieces of jerky from his pocket. She ate both of the treats and then laid her head on his knee in thanks. He pet her head a few times and went back to his work. She went about her own business, sniffing the ground for the path to which she belonged. </p>
		<p class="para-para-paragraph">When darkness came, the man finished his work and retired to his comfy chair with his favorite beer. The little dog had been absorbed in a lengthy chase with some local squirrels for most of the afternoon, as it was one of her favorite ways to spend an afternoon, and she noticed that it was getting dark and she should probably find somewhere to sleep for the night. There wasn't much around, and she was just starting to get a bit worried when she heard the man's voice from his back porch. He must have spotted her moving around in the yard. He was calling to her, inviting her inside. She trotted over and the man pet her head a couple of times before leading her into the house. She watched as he set a blanket on the floor by the fireplace and filled a bowl with leftovers from dinner for her. After she emptied her bowl, she walked over to the man, who was back in his comfy chair with another beer. She wagged her tail at him, and he smiled, and patted his lap. She hopped onto his lap, curled up, and he gently pet her while they both fell asleep in the comfy chair. </p>
	
	<p class="para-para-para-paragraph">The next morning, the man got up with the sun and began cooking himself a hearty breakfast. The little dog watched him, enjoying his methodical manner in the kitchen. She liked the tunes that he hummed as he went through his morning routine. When he was finished eating and cleaning up, he tossed the extra egg and sausages that he had prepared into the bowl she'd eaten dinner from. She followed him outside, where he gave her a little nod, and she gave him a wag of her tail, and they both went about their days. He worked for a long time, feeding the chickens and sheep and the spotted horse and working on repairs and . They were all quite calm and went about their businesses. The little dog spent most of the day chasing the local squirrels again, but took breaks to observe the happenings on the farm and to visit with the man when he rested from his work. She joined him for most of these breaks, and he gave her bites of jerky and pet her head.</p>
	
	<p class="para-para-para-para-paragraph">When the work day was over, the old man called for the little dog. It was only a few moments before he saw her large ears bouncing up and down as she ran toward him. She waved her long tail back and forth as she trotted the last few feet to the back porch where the man stood. The man smiled and held the back door open for her. Tonight's dinner was lamb stew, which had been in the slow cooker for most of the day. The little dog lain on the blanket while the man drank his beer and watched television until he fell asleep in his comfy chair.</p>
